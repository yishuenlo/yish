        <p>Continue learning React on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.</p>
        <p>Main takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>JSX is not Javascript nor HTML. Its syntax is like HTML, but it's an extension of Javascript. And you write JSX in JavaScript file.</li>
          <li>You need "translator" to compile and translate JSX into Javascript. (Something like Babel? I needed to install Node for React to work... need to learn this later.)</li>
          <li><code>React</code> and <code>ReactDOM</code> are different. <code>React</code> is a JS library for buildig UI, <code>ReactDOM</code> is the JS library for React to interacte with DOM. You need to import both into JavaScript file for React to work properly.</li>
          <li>React uses Virtual DOM to reduce re-rendering DOM from scratch everytime something is updated. Virtual DOM is lightweight, so React compares current version of Virtual DOM from previous version to figure what changed, and only update the content that changed from previous version.</li>
          <li><strong>Analogy for Virtual DOM = Home Improvements</strong>: update and compare CAD/Sketchup plans, and remodel specific rooms that changed instead of rebuilding the whole house from scratch every time you want to do home improvements.</li>
          <li>Call Javascript within JSX with <code>{ }</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Learning React on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. The React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial was getting too confusing and I needed to start from scratch to understand every single details about React, rather than just jumping in to build an app without proper understanding of JSX, ReactDOM and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-virtual-dom" target="_blank">Virtual DOM</a>.</p>

        <p>P.S. I'm also testing out VS Code to see how I like it, since Gatsby and Design.Code both used VS Code for React. I think I like an intergrated terminal in the code editor... but I don't know how to use the terminal to commit to my github yet. Once I figured this out, it'll make my life easier and just keep all of my coding activities within one app window.</p>
        <p>P.P.S Since this code log is so repetitive and componenet-heavy, it'll be good to convert this website into React Components.</p>

        <p>Go through React tutorial, Completing the Game, and getting confused. Main takeaway, have parent component change the state of the children components by passing props. Do not have parent asking for the children's state.</p>
        <p>"To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass the state back down to the children by using props; this keeps the child components in sync with each other and with the parent component." - <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game" target="_blank">React</a></p>

        <p>After spending sometime putting together the pages for HLC Plan Overview manually - literally putting in the html for every single page. I wonder if there are ways to automate it with templates. After some research, I came across static website, static website generator, and <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAM</a> (Javascript, API and Markup)</p>
        <p>JAM allows developers to focus on front-end development and not having to worry about server coding. And it's lightweight so I don't have to get bogged down by CMSs like Wordpress. Which is exactly what I need. </p>
        <p>I browsed <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank">StaticGen</a> for options. Since I'd like to continue using Javascript and not learn any new languages to develop templates and automate my website pages, I've decided on learning and using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>.</p>
        <p>Gatsby uses React for its template, so I'll be learning <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank">React</a> so I can be proficient enough to play with and customize Gatsby starters templates. I can't wait to start JAMing soon!</p>

        <p>What is command line and why should I use it?</p>
        <p><strong>What is the Command Line?</strong> Command Line a simple, basic way to communicate with our computers. Our computers have evolved to use Graphic User Interface for users to communicate with computers - such as Window Explorers. GUI is intuitive and visual, and requires mostly mouse clicks. On the other hand, Command Line only uses keyboard and text.</p>
        <p><strong>Why should I use the Command Line?</strong> Command Line offers more ways to communicate with my computer through one channel, versus jumping through different locations and window explorers. For example, Git uses command line. What it does is that the Command Line has ALL control of Git, whereas if I use a GUI version, I'd have to install Github and uses Github's app to access different versions of Git. While Github is more intuitive, it doens't offer more power and control.</p>
        <p>One example of how Github doesn't have more control is when I had to use different Github users. Switching through Github is hard and confusing... and almost seems impossible. Just becasue I logged out of Github doesn't mean my computer is unlinked from my previous Git source. So while my Github is saying I've logged out of <code>loys73</code> and is now using <code>yishuenlo</code>, my computer's Git is still linked to <code>loys73</code>.</p>
        <p>Apparently using command line is also easier to many batches of files, such as changing file names just for .txt file. In summary, Command Line is the most rudimentary way to communicate with computers, but also the easier way to control and let communters understand what we need from them. Almost like comparing 文言文 and 白話文.</p>

        <p>Added javascript and toggle interaction works. However, due to different z-index for header navbar and hamburger menu, they create another issue. The expanded hamburger menu should cover up everything, including the header, but hamburger icon is inside the header. Therefoe, it's either the whole menu covers everything up, including the hamburger icon. Or hamburger icon is showing, but header is also on top of expanded menu.</p>
        <p>Potential solution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Move hamburger icon out of <code>header</code>, and into <code>nav</code>.</li>
          <li>Hide rest of the items in header, except hamburger icon</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Decided to go with option 2 and hide header when clicking on hamburger icon. So the changes are just within CSS and Javascript, and no need to shuffle the structure in HTML.</p>
        <p>Next step: add navigation at the footer.</p>

        <p>Based on viewing from the inspector for <a href="https://gardenestudio.com.br/index.php" target="_blank">gardenestudio</a>, I can see:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><code>data-v</code> changes from 0 to 1 as I scroll from top to dowon. It seems <code>data-v</code> controlls the length of these vector lines.</li>
          <li>In each individual <code>path</code> tag, there is a <code>style: "stroke-dasharray"</code> assigned to it. And <code>stroke-dasharray</code> has to number that changes values as I scroll.</li>
          <li>The main <code>svg</code> tag has classes changing from <code>skrollable-before</code> to <code>skrollable-between</code>, as I scroll through the page.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Challenges: I can't find the CSS for these classes... will need to dig around to find them.</p>

        <p>Turn fixed navbar into sticky navbar. Move <code>nav</code> to the same <code>div</code> as main content, and use main content's <code>offsetTop</code> property to figure out when to apply <code>sticky</code> class to <code>nav</code>.</p>
        <p>Made header fixed, so it has a visible button for the full plan throughout the website. The button is readily available for people who would want to see the full plan pdf, and addressed concern for using website vs pdf for planning documents. Fixed sticky navbar to accommodate the extra header height.</p>

        <p>Fixed parallax layers so they're displaying properly without extra overlaps. Fixes include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assign different window heights to keyart container and individual key art layers. Container has less height to crop out the bigger layers.</li>
          <li>Assigning <code>z-index</code> to articles, so main content is above parallax and cover up the overlaps. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Issues: <code>fixed</code> table of content is now beneath everything, since it doesn' have <code>z-index</code> assigned. In other words, TOC needs to be below hero article, but on top of main contents. But main content needs to be above of hero article. Will need to find alternative to fix <code>z-index</code> issue. Possible solution could be adding another article that's above hero, but below main. </p>

        <p>Study parallax image at <a href="http://www.firewatchgame.com/" target="_blank">FireWatch</a>. Main takeaways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Breaking down images into layers</li>
          <li>Create a parallax container <code>div</code>, and place each layer as a <code>div</code> under the container</li>
          <li>Put backround layer in the top <code>div</code>, foreground at the last <code>div</code></li>
          <li>Use <code>background-image</code> to load each image layer in CSS</li>
          <li>Create <code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp" target="_blank">data-</a></code> attribute for scrolling speed, so JavaScipt can control the translation as mouse scrolls</li>
          <li>Write javascript function that has event listener for mouse scroll. As mouse scrolls, each image layer will move at a different speed assigned by the <code>data-speed</code> attribute</li>
        </ol>
        <p>note: will need to find a good image for parallax layers. And design the landing page for The Plan for the HLC.</p>

        <p>Study the basics of creating parallax using CSS.</p>
        <p>Main takeaway: use <code>background</code> properties to create parallax effects. <code>background-attachment</code> is the backbone of parallax effect. Use <code>fixed</code> to make background fixed relative to hte viewpoert, so it doesn't move with other elements.</p>
        <p><code>
          background-attachment: fixed; <br>
          background-position: center; <br>
          background-repeat: no-repeat; <br>
          background-size: cover;
        </code></p>

        <p>Use <code>min-height</code> to set a specific height for background image. Must add enough content, aka enough height to the next article, for scrolling effects to be apparent.</p>
