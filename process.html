        <p>The intent of this website is to document my habit building process. In James Clear's Atomic Habit book, in order to develop a habit, it's important to consistenly <em>show up</em> in good days and bad days, to have accountability, and to make it satisfying.</p>
        <p>The existence of this website is to address accountability. By documenting my progress to the world, I am holding myself accountable on my habit building.</p>
        <p>To make it <em>satisfying</em>, I've developed a system to help me <em>earn</em> expensive toys I've always wanted, but could never justisfy the purchases: MacBook Pro and Wacom Cintiq Pro.</p>
        <p>Using RPG game as a metaphor, MacBook Pro and Cintiq Pro are the fancy weapons for high level players. And I am slowly earning my experience and leveling up so I could wield these weapons to their fullest potential. And also I don't just spend a shit ton of money and just use them once or twice, but actually consistenly using them because I've build a habit of coding and painting already. ;)</p>

        <h2>Habit System</h2>
        <p>So here is how this works: for everyday I showed up and work on my habit, I will put a certain amount of money into my savings for my rewards. In this case, MacBook Pro and Cintiq Pro. The amount of money I <em>earn</em> is based on the phases of my habit process. </p>
        <h3>Habit Phasing</h3>
        <ul class="habit-phasing">
          <li>Phase 1: Code/paint for at least 10 mins ($1)</li>
          <li>Phase 2: Code/paint for at least 30 mins ($2)</li>
          <li>Phase 3: Code/paint for at least an hour ($3)</li>
          <li>Phase 4: TBD ($4)</li>
          <li>Phase 5: TBD ($5)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this system, I am building my habit and skills, and earn the right to use my expensive toys. And yes, I also intentionally picked very expensive toys because it'd take me at least 2 years to practice these habits consistently, so by the time I do receive my toys, I'd be amazing at coding and digital painting already (I think... I hope... or maybe just not suck.)</p>
        <p>To proceed to the next phase, I plan to do quarterly review to reflect on my progress and see if I am ready to move onto the next phase, and if I will need to make any adjustments to my habit building. This is why phase 4 and phase 5 are TBD, because I am not sure what is practical at this point. I will need more time to think about them and update them in the future.</p>
